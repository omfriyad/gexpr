In this repo we will be developing a system to recognise gesture from human input through stream of image data

Things to do: 
Things to learn:
1. Numpy 
2. Pandas
3. Matrices and operation (theoritical)
4. Basic Image Processing and applying image filter
5. Basics of Neural Network - http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ 3 chapters 
6. Understading the core of CNN and Nural Nets 
7. Combination of each image aka [Euiclidan Distance I guess]
Research to do: 
1. Find some papers on human gesture from image 
2. Find Dataset
3. Look up some demo projects
